# tictac-toe-board

this is a tic tac toe game 
Is based on a project from the book automating the boring stuff with python

for each turn the code will switch between the X or the O (starting with the X)
to choose where to put the X or the O on the board simply type: 'top mid-L' or 'mid-M' and so on
